  "Synopsis": "Create an HTML change report.",
  "Description": "New-ADChangeReport will create an HTML report showing changes to Active Directory users, computers, and groups since a given date and time. The command uses Get-ADObject to query the WhenChanged property. The objects are organized by class and/or container and written to an HTML file. The command uses a CSS file from the ADReportingTools module, although you can specify your own. To make the HTML file portable, you can opt to embed the CSS content from a file source.",
