  "Synopsis": "Create an HTML report of your domain.",
  "Description": "This command will create an HTML report of your domain. The report layout is by container and organizational unit. Underneath each branch will be a table display of users, computers, and groups. Beneath each group will be a table of recursive group members. You should get detail about users and computers if you hover the mouse over the distinguished name.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ADReportingTools module includes a CSS file which will be used by default. But you can specify an alternate CSS file. If you want to make the file portable, you can opt to embed the CSS into the HTML file. You can only embed from a file, not a URL reference.",
